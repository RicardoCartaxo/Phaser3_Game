# Phaser3_Game

A game built using the Phaser 3 framework. Part of a project for the Multimedia course of the FCTUC.

The game consists of a main map (built using Tiled, a software to build tile based maps) where 
the player can choose to play one of three mini games included.

In one of these minigames, BubblePopper, the player must pop the chemistry based bubbles using his mouse.
In another game, Food Fight, the player has to pick up enough food items to reach the objective score
before the timer runs out.
In the last game, Mechanic, the player must cross the street. Mechanic is based on the event which sometimes
takes place in Polo 2 on Fridays, where a lot of people gather and race around; until the police shows up.

The game is by no means optimized. In fact, given more free time I would have implemented a class Saver which would
handle all the saving and loading of the game. Plus, I think I would also join all the "background music" classes
into one big "background music handler", to simplify a lot of code and get rid of some annoying Phaser-related bugs.
